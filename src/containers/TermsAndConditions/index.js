                <p className="info-text">
                Where BULLZ provisions an affiliate link attached to your User Generated Content, BULLZ commits that should a commission generating purchase be completed that can be absolutely attributed to the link associated with your content, BULLZ will apportion 50% of these commissions to you. BULLZ may, at our sole discretion and with notice, adjust this commission level. Any commissions will be displayed within the Apps for your information. Upon provision of bank details that are accessible from within the German banking system, these funds will be transferred to you from time to time. Typically, this will be when the balance is in excess of €1000, however transfer may be requested at a lower balance. Any and all fees associated with this transfer will be borne by you. The commission statement as shown within the Apps is complete. Once all commission transactions have passed any periods allowed for refund and reversal, the commission is considered final and final transactions will be noted within the Apps as such. You may ask for an audit of your commissions statement via support@BULLZ.com. Any audit results are considered complete and final and no further action is possible for the time period covered by the audit.

                <p className="info-text">
                Bullz provides a technology platform which Creators can utilize to create their own “Airdrop” contests in which users can win NFTs.  These NFTs may or may not come with user experiences, which are defined and provided by the Creator.
                <br/><br/>
                Bullz does not sponsor, endorse or administer these contests; they are administered by the individual Creators and sponsored by the Creators or their designees. Contests are in no way sponsored, endorsed, administered or associated with Bullz. Creators are solely responsible for their own Contests.
                NFTs, WOM, and any other digital assets available in contests and otherwise on Bullz (1) are not “currency,” “money,” legal tender or substitutes for them, (2) they are instead items of ordinary personal property, (3) they may not be transferable to external platforms and are only useable on the Bullz or affiliate platforms for the express purposes set forth by us, (4) they may not be tradeable with third parties for other digital assets, money or other forms of consideration, and (5) they have no cash value.
                <br/><br/>
                As a User (and contest Entrant) or Creator, you acknowledge and agree with all of the above facts and terms of this section.
                <br/><br/>
                As a Creator, you further agree to the following provisions regarding your Airdrop Contests (the “Contest” or “Contests”):
                <br/><br/>
                You will register with the authorities or otherwise comply with all applicable laws regarding your Contest in every jurisdiction from which your contest is accessible to entrants, and in which such registration is required.
                <br/><br/>
                You will, clearly and conspicuously, provide to entrants a Contest Rules in writing containing all materially-relevant information, including, without limitation, your identity and contact information, offer terms and eligibility requirements (e.g., age and residency restrictions), term or cycle of contest (including dates winners will be chosen and notified),  an explanation of all methods of entry,  details regarding efforts required/non-monetary consideration required to be eligible to win, clear disclosure of the winner-selection method/judging criteria showing how the winners were determined based on objective criteria, the odds of winning, what the contents of the NFT and any associated user experiences are,  the amount in dollar value awarded per item, per Contest/cycle and per year, how  winners are chosen, how payment and/or other details are collected, if applicable, and liability limitations.
                <br/><br/>
                You will include in your Contest Rules, prominently and conspicuously, the statement (substituting your name as Creator) that: Bullz is not associated with, and does not sponsor, endorse or administer this Contest; it is administered by [Creator] and sponsored by [Creator] and/or [Creator's] designees.
                <br/><br/>
                If a winner's or entrant's information will be used promotionally, you will obtain advance written consent from them to do so.
                <br/><br/>
                If you do not register within every US state or territory your Contest is accessible (if any), you will limit the total aggregate value available to $5000 in rewards for each individual contest or cycle.
                <br/><br/>
                If you do not file 1099 tax information returns for every US person who receives value in your Contest, you will keep the total value actually awarded to such persons to under $600 per calendar year per person.
                <br/><br/>
                You will not require a cash purchase or payment or any other thing of value, for entrants to enter the Contest, unless you are registered or otherwise comply with all local laws of the entrant's jurisdiction to permit such. “Any thing of value” includes any substantial expenditure of time or effort that benefits you, as well as the collection of contact or other user information to be used for marketing purposes, or the transfer from the entrant of intellectual property ownership of, or all rights to, their Contest submission to you.
                <br/><br/>
                You will not use any brand name or copyrighted material in a Contest name or promotion without the written consent of the owner of the corresponding trademark or copyright.  However, you may list items bearing or including trademarks or copyrights without any special permission from the IP owner in the official rules as part of the prize list, if such trademark or copyright is used to the minimum extent reasonably necessary to describe the prize item, and is otherwise in keeping with trademark or copyright fair use.
                <br/><br/>
                You will provide to users, clearly and conspicuously, the disclaimers “No Purchase Necessary” and “Void where prohibited”.
                You will not give away in a Contest, to any entrant in the US, any prize which is or may be considered a security in the US under the Securities Act of 1933, or to any entrant in any other jurisdiction, any security or other regulated financial instrument in the entrant's jurisdiction.
                You agree to hold Bullz harmless for any entrant or third party claims arising out of any of your Contests, and agree to defend and indemnify Bullz from all such claims.
                <br/><br/>
                Your Contest will not give any prize award to, or otherwise engage with any individual or entity sanctioned by the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), or by any comparable authority or prohibition list of the European Union or United Kingdom. 
                <br/><br/>
                FTC Endorsement Compliance.  To the extent your Contest requires entrants in, or making communications with respect to the US to perform actions (such as social media posting, making videos, “liking” or “retweeting”) that consist of commercial recommendations or endorsements for a commercial product or service, you hereby agree to require these entrants to comply with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Endorsement Guidelines (available at https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-publishes-final-guides-governing-endorsements-testimonials/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf).  These rules require that material connections between venders/advertisers and endorsers be clearly and conspicuously disclosed. This means, in the content of any recommendation that entrants provide as part of a Contest which consists of or contains an endorsement or assessment of a referred product and/or brand, entrants must prominently disclose the fact that they may receive compensation for such recommendations (i.e., the contest prizes). A FAQ with further details is available at https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking#affiliateornetwork.

                We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and BULLZ agree that you and BULLZ are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms. <br/><br/>

                YOU AND BULLZ AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.<br/><br/>

If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without BULLZ’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. BULLZ may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. <br/><br/>

                    BULLZ’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of BULLZ. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. <br/><br/>
