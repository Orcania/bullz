                <p className="info-text">
                When you start using our Service or want to create and share a video, we ask you for consent to use your camera, microphone, location, and face recognition in a pop-up. If you do not give permission, we will not use that capability. You may not be able to use all features of our Service in this case. You can later give or revoke your consent in the settings.
                <br/><br/>
                If you allow access to these capabilities, the mobile app will only access your data and transfer it to our server as necessary to provide the functionality (according to Art. 6 (1) S.1 f EU-GDPR). Your data will be treated confidentially and deleted if you revoke the rights to use or are no longer required to provide the services and there are no legal retention requirements. Please note that your User Generated Content, username and profile image will be retained as per the Terms and Conditions.
                <br/><br/>
                Our Service includes so-called Location Based Services, with which we offer special offers that are tailored to your particular location. You can only use these functions after you have agreed via a pop-up that we can collect your location data by means of supplying you home country, your phones locale setting, GPS and/or your IP address in anonymous form for the purposes of providing services. You can allow or revoke the GPS function in the settings of the app at any time by going to your system “Settings”.
                <br/><br/>
                Our Service also includes fraud prevention features such as face recognition to unlock and access your wallet. You can only use these functions after you have agreed via pop-up that we can collect your biometric data by means of facial recognition software.
                <br/><br/>
                Recent advancements in the capabilities of some mobile devices means that we are able to offer content production techniques based upon the 3d Depth data enabled by these devices. At this time, BULLZ does not support 3d video content and as such, the 3D depth data is retained only on your device. Any video resulting from the use of this 3d depth data is reduced to 2d standard video formats and the 3d depth data is discarded.
